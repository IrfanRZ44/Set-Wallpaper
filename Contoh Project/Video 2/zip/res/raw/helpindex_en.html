  <h2><a name="preferences">Preferences</a></h2><br />

  <h3><a name="videofileordirectory">Video file or directory</a></h3>
  <p>Select this to choose the video file to play back as your wallpaper. You can browse through
  the entire file system of your phone. The <i>&lt;go up to ...&gt;</i> option goes one directory back.
  Your SD card's home directory can be found in the top most directory (it is usually <i>/sdcard/</i>) and is colored red.</p>
  <p>You can choose a single file or an entire directory for play back. If you select the entire directory, then all
  videos from that directory (and possibly subdirectories) will be played, according to the preferences below.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>
  
  <h3><a name="recursivedirectory">Recursive directory</a></h3>
  <p>This option enables all subdirectories in addition to the selected directory.</p>
  <p>This option is disabled if a single video file is chosen for play back, rather than a directory.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>

  <h3><a name="randomfile"></a>Random file</h3>
  <p>If you enable this option then video files are played in a random order. If you disable this option then video
  files are played in an alphabetical order.</p>
  <p>This option is disabled if a single video file is chosen for play back, rather than a directory.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>

  <h3><a name="swipingsmoothness"></a>Swiping smoothness</h3>
  <p>You can choose what you want smoother when swiping between home screens. <i>Smoother swiping animation</i> makes all
  the icons and widgets appear to slide smoother, but freezes the video in the background. <i>Smoother video</i> does the
  opposite: it doesn't freeze the video, but the widgets and icons may not slide as smooth.</p>
  <p>This effect is only visible on some home screen replacement apps, like Launcher Pro.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>

  <h3><a name="renderingmode">Rendering mode</a></h3>
  <p>You can choose the way that videos will draw to the screen. <i>Classic mode</i> fits the video in the same way that
  images are fitted when used for a wallpaper. The video will always fill out the entire display and the borders that
  didn't fit will be cut away. These borders are then used for the shifting action when the user is swiping the screen.
  <i>Letterboxed mode</i> does the opposite: it always shows the entire video on the screen, even if it means introducing
  black borders. <i>Stretched mode</i> stretches the video over the entire display so no part is cut off and there are no
  black borders, but the video might end up looking distorted.
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>

  <h3><a name="donotskip">Do not skip frames</a></h3>
  <p>Sometimes videos are too complex to be played back smoothly. They are either too big in resolution or have
  a frame rate that is too high. If this option is disabled then the live wallpaper will attempt to skip frames
  to play the video as close to the original speed as possible. Enable this option if you prefer smooth animation
  and don't care much about slow speed.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>

  <h3><a name="shiftvideo">Shift video</a></h3>
  <p>If this option is enabled then the video will shift left and right when swiping between home screens.
  If this option is disabled then the video will stay centered.</p>
  <p>This effect is only visible if the video is wider than the screen.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>

  <h3><a name="swipinglag"></a>Swiping lag</h3>
  <p>This setting tells the live wallpaper how fast it should shift the video when swiping. You can
  select one of five stages, ranging from <i>instant</i> which shifts the video at the same time as swiping occurs,
  to <i>slow</i> which makes the shifting animation very slow.</p>
  <p>This setting has no effect if the video is not wider than the screen. This setting is disabled if video shifting is disabled.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>

  <h3><a name="debugmode">Debug mode</a></h3>
  <p>If this option is enabled then the current/wanted FPS value is displayed at the center of the wallpaper.
  Also, the device's logcat is filled with all kinds of debugging information. Keep this option disabled unless
  you are making a video and want to see the FPS or you are instructed to turn it on by the support/developer.</p>

  <br /><br /><hr />
  <h2><a name="supportedvideoformats">Supported Video Formats</a></h2><br />
  
  <p>This live wallpaper uses FFmpeg to decode videos. This means that every video format that FFmpeg supports is
  also supported here. These include:
  <ul> <li>.avi</li><li>.mp4</li><li>.3gp</li><li>.mpg</li><li>.flv</li><li>.3g2</li><li>.asf</li><li>.dv</li>
  <li>.mov</li><li>.mpeg</li><li>.rm</li><li>.vcd</li><li>.vob</li><li>.wmv</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <p>Many video codecs are also supported. Please refer to the FFmpeg documentation for the complete list.</p>
  
  <p>Audio is not supported as this is a live wallpaper and is not supposed to emit sounds.</p>

  <h3><a name="recommendedvideocodecs">Recommended video codecs/formats</a></h3>
  <p>While this live wallpaper supports many video formats and codecs, some of them are more suitable than others.</p>
  <p>The most recommended codecs/formats are (in this order):
  <ul>
  <li>mpeg1video (MPEG-1) with .mpg format</li>
  <li>mpeg2video (MPEG-2) with .vob format</li>
  <li>mjpeg (Motion JPEG) with .avi format</li>
  <li>mpeg4 (Mpeg-4 part 2, commonly known as DivX, XviD or 3ivX) with .avi format</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>There are some codecs/formats that are common on android devices but are not recommended due to excessive
  complexity which makes them decode slow and unnecessarily wastes battery power:
  <ul>
  <li>h263 (H.263) with .3gp format</li>
  <li>h264 (H.264) with .mp4 or .flv format</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>
  
  <h3><a name="recommendedvideosize">Recommended video sizes and frame rates</a></h3>
  <p>Because of the limited resources of your device, you have to be careful about the resolution and frame
  rate when making videos for live wallpapers. If the resolution is too big then the video might be skipping
  frames or the live wallpaper might even crash because of shortage of memory. The general upper limit to the
  resolution should be <b>854x480 pixels</b>. The general upper limit to frame rate should be <b>30 FPS</b>.
  You should not go to the maximum resolution and frame rate in the same video!</p>
  
  <p>One way of calculating if your settings are OK is to multiply them. Multiply:
  <pre>  width * height * frame rate</pre>
  If you get &lt;=3.400.000, you can use any codec. If you get &lt;=5.800.000, you can use any recommended codec.
  If you get &lt;=8.200.000, you should only use mpeg1video or mpeg2video. You shouldn't get more than 8.200.000!
  If you do, decrease size or frame rate.</p>
  
  <p>The most common resolution/frame rate combinations that are recommended (4:3 or 16:9 ratio):
  <ul>
  <li>264x200 or 356x200 at 30FPS (any codec)</li>
  <li>320x240 or 428x240 at 30FPS (any codec)</li>
  <li>480x360 or 640x360 at 25FPS (recommended codecs)</li>
  <li>480x360 or 640x360 at 30FPS (mpeg1video or mpeg2video)</li>
  <li>640x480 or 854x480 at 20FPS (mpeg1video or mpeg2video)</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <p>Any resolution below 854x480 is supported so if your video has a non-standard resolution, do the calculation
  above and if it fits into any of the three categories, resizing is not required.</p>
  <p><a href="#top">&lt;Back to top&gt;</a><br /><br /></p>
  
  <h3><a name="awordaboutbitrate">A word about bitrate</a></h3>
  <p>When you are reencoding video, you are often asked to provide a bitrate. A bitrate is a number which
  tells the codec how much storage space on average it is allowed to spend on a single second of video. The unit is
  <i>bits per second</i> or just <i>bps</i>. This number is usually very large so it is often shortened by a factor
  of 1000. Such a value has a unit called <i>kilobits per second</i> or <i>kbps</i>.</p>
  
  <p>The bitrate is used to find a compromise between the video file's size and the video quality. With a small bitrate,
  the file is small but the video is of very bad quality. As the bitrate is increased, the quality gets
  better but the file size gets bigger.</p>
  
  <p>If you don't care much about file size, then a high bitrate like 3000 kbps should be more than enough to produce
  nice quality videos at the recommended resolutions and frame rates. Generally, the bitrate gives an estimate of the
  resulting file size. The formula involved is:
  <pre>  video_size_in_MB = bitrate_in_kbps * 128 * video_length_in_seconds</pre>
  This holds true if there is no audio and if the bitrate is not too small for the given resolution.</p>
  
  <p>You should also consider what codec you use. Some codecs need more bitrate to generate a nice quality image than
  others. 3000 kbps should be more than enough for mpeg4 for example, but might not be enough for mjpeg or mpeg1video.</p>

  <p>Do not go overboard with the bitrate. Keep in mind that storage memory in phones and other embedded devices is slower
  than on most bigger machines. A 100 MB file for a minute of a video is probably too much!</p>

  <h3><a name="reencodingwithffmpeg">Reencoding video with FFmpeg</a></h3>
  <p>FFmpeg is a free tool that can be used to reencode your videos to a more appropriate codec/format for the
  live wallpaper. FFmpeg can be found all over the internet and is available for Windows, Linux and Mac. Search
  for "<i>ffmpeg executable for windows/linux/mac</i>" to find it. If you are using linux then FFmpeg is probably
  already included with your setup.</p>
  
  <p>FFmpeg is a console executable. On Windows you access it via the Command Prompt (cmd.exe), on Linux or Mac
  you use a terminal. Usage of cmd or terminal is beyond the scope of this help so search the internet if you need
  additional help. Alternatively, you can look for graphical frontends to FFmpeg but then this chapter will probably
  not be of much use to you.</p>
  
  <p>To get information about your existing video file, use the following command:
  <pre>  ffmpeg -i "video file"</pre>
  This command will output all the information about the <i>video file</i>. Look for the video stream, where you will
  be able to find the duration, bitrate, codec, resolution and frame rate (fps or tbr). If everything fits the
  recommended values in the previous chapters then the video doesn't need reencoding and is ready. If such a video
  contains audio and you would like to get rid of it as it is not needed, the following command does this quickly:
  <pre>  ffmpeg -i "video file" -an -vcodec copy "output file"</pre>
  This command will make an <i>output file</i> that only contains video from the <i>video file</i>.</p>
  
  <p>To fully reencode the video, use the following command:
  <pre>  ffmpeg [options_1] -i "video file" -an [options_2] -vcodec &lt;video_codec&gt; -vb &lt;bitrate&gt; "output file"</pre>
  Substitute <i>[options_1]</i> with zero, one or more of the following:
  <ul>
  <li>-ss time_in_seconds<br />if you wish to skip to <i>time_in_seconds</i> and start encoding from there</li>
  <li>-t time_in_seconds<br />if you wish to encode only <i>time_in_seconds</i> seconds of the video</li>
  </ul>
  Substitute <i>[options_2]</i> with zero, one or more of the following:
  <ul>
  <li>-s size<br />if you wish to resize the video (for example to <i>640x480</i>)</li>
  <li>-r framerate<br />if you wish to set a new frame rate in FPS (for example to <i>25</i> or <i>23.976</i>)</li>
  </ul>
  Substitute <i>&lt;video_codec&gt;</i> with one of the supported video codecs, for example <i>mpeg1video</i> or <i>mpeg4</i>.</p>
  
  <p>Substitute <i>&lt;bitrate&gt;</i> with the wanted bitrate in bits per second, for example <i>1000000</i> or <i>1000k</i>, which is the same.</p>
  
  <p>If you wish to keep the sound (which will NOT be played as the live wallpaper), substitute <i>-an</i> with <i>-acodec copy</i>.</p>
  
  <p>---</p>
  <p>An example of a full command would be:
  <pre>  ffmpeg -ss 15 -i "myvideo.avi" -an -s 640x360 -vcodec mpeg4 -vb 1500k "result.avi"</pre>
  This command would:
  <ul>
  <li>start at the 15th second of the original video</li>
  <li>encode until the end of the original video (because -t option is missing)</li>
  <li>encode the myvideo.avi file (the "original" video)</li>
  <li>cut out and disable the sound from the result (the -an flag)</li>
  <li>resize the result to 640x360</li>
  <li>keep the same frame rate as in the original video (because -r option is missing)</li>
  <li>use the mpeg4 (DivX/XviD/3ivX) video codec to encode</li>
  <li>use the bitrate of 1.500.000 bits per second</li>
  <li>save the result into the file named result.avi</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>---</p>
  <p>The FFmpeg supports much more options than are mentioned and explained here. Please refer to the documentation of FFmpeg to find out more.</p>
